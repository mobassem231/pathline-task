# pathline-task2

Summary of Changes and Features:

Multi-level Dropdowns: Implemented by nesting <ul> elements with dropdown and dropdown-content classes.

Animations:

Desktop: Smooth opacity and transform transitions for dropdowns appearing on hover. The caret icon also rotates.

Mobile: max-height transition for a "slide down" effect when a dropdown is toggled.

Responsiveness:

Desktop: Standard horizontal navigation with hover-activated dropdowns.

Mobile (screen width <= 768px):

The main navigation transforms into a vertical stacking menu, toggled by a hamburger icon.

Dropdowns are activated by clicking the parent menu item, expanding/collapsing with an animation.

The dropdowns no longer use absolute positioning, instead stacking vertically below their parent.

User-Friendly:

Clear visual cues (caret icon).

Intuitive hover (desktop) and click (mobile) interactions for dropdowns.

Smooth animations provide a modern and engaging experience.

Hamburger menu for clear mobile navigation
